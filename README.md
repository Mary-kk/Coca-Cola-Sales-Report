# Task

The main tasks for this project include:
•	Analysing Coca-Cola's sales data to identify key trends and insights.
•	Visualising sales distribution by retailer, region, and state.
•	Identifying factors that influence operating profit.
•	Creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard in Power BI.


# The Process


Data Collection: Gather Coca-Cola sales data, including metrics such as total sales, units sold, price per unit, operating profit, and operating margin.
Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data and uncover key insights.
Dashboard Design: Design and develop visualisations to represent the sales data effectively.
Integration: Integrate all visualisations into a cohesive Power BI dashboard.


# Tools Used
Power BI Desktop: This is used to design and create the dashboard.
Microsoft Excel: For data preprocessing and cleaning.
Microsoft Power Query: For data transformation and shaping within Power BI.


# Techniques
Data Visualization: Using charts, graphs, and maps to represent sales data visually.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysing the data to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
Key Influencers Analysis: Identifying factors that impact operating profit using Power BI's Key Influencers visualisation.
Interactive Filtering: Implementing date range filters and other interactive elements to enhance user experience.


# Deliverable
The deliverable for this project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that includes visualizations such as a pie chart showing total sales by retailer, a bar chart for regional performance, and a map for state-wise sales distribution. It also features a Key Influencers analysis identifying factors affecting operating profit, a date range filter for trend analysis, and a detailed sales metrics table. Additionally, summary cards provide key figures like total sales, units sold, and operating profit.
